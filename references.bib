  abstract   = {Toward enhancing the reliability of the Linux file
                system, we are developing a new log-structured file
                system (NILFS) for the Linux operating system. Instead
                of overwriting existing blocks, NILFS appends
                consistent sets of modified or newly created blocks
                continuously into segmented disk regions. This writing
                method allows NILFS to achieve faster recovery time and
                higher write performance. The address of the block that
                is written to changes for each write, which makes it
                difficult to apply modern file system technologies such
                as B-tree structures. To permit such writing on the
                Linux kernel basis, NILFS has its own write mechanism
                that handles data and meta data as one unit and allows
                them to be relocated. This paper presents the design
                and implementation of NILFS focussing on the write
                mechanism.},
